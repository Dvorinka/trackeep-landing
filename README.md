### Service Architecture

Trackeep production deployment consists of **3 essential services**:

#### **🎯 Frontend Service**
- **Image**: `ghcr.io/Dvorinka/Trackeep/frontend:latest`
- **Ports**: `80:80`, `443:443`
- **Purpose**: Web interface and user experience
- **Health**: Depends on backend service

#### **🔧 Backend Service**
- **Image**: `ghcr.io/Dvorinka/Trackeep/backend:latest`
- **Ports**: `8080:8080`
- **Purpose**: API server and business logic
- **Health**: Built-in health check endpoint

#### **🗄️ Database Service**
- **Image**: `postgres:15-alpine`
- **Purpose**: Data persistence and storage
- **Health**: PostgreSQL readiness check
- **Storage**: Persistent volume for data

### Required Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file from the provided `.env.example` and configure these required variables:

```env
# Database Configuration
DB_PASSWORD=your_secure_password
POSTGRES_PASSWORD=your_secure_password

# Security Configuration
JWT_SECRET=your_jwt_secret_key
ENCRYPTION_KEY=your_32_character_encryption_key
```

### AI Services Configuration

AI services are now configured **only within the Trackeep application**. No environment variables are needed for AI configuration. Simply:

1. Start Trackeep with the basic configuration above
2. Navigate to Settings → AI Services in the application
3. Add your API tokens and configure AI providers in the app interface
4. Enable/disable AI services as needed through the app settings

### Version Management

Trackeep uses GitHub Docker images with the `:latest` tag. The application version is automatically managed through the Docker image tags and update checking is handled through the OAuth service. No manual version configuration is needed in the environment variables.

### Version Detection

The system automatically detects the running version through multiple methods:

- **Docker Detection**: Identifies container image tags
- **Environment Variables**: Uses `TRACKEEP_VERSION` if set
- **Version Files**: Reads from `/app/VERSION` or similar
- **Git Tags**: Detects version when running from source

Access version information via the API:
```bash
curl http://localhost:8080/api/version
```

All other variables have sensible defaults and can be configured as needed.

## Installation Options

### Docker Compose
**Easy**
**5 minutes**

Quickest way to get started with pre-built containers. Perfect for production.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Dvorinka/Trackeep.git
cd trackeep
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env file with your configuration
docker-compose up -d
```

### From Source
**Medium**
**15 minutes**

Build from source for maximum customization and development flexibility.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Dvorinka/Trackeep.git
cd trackeep
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env file with your configuration
docker-compose up -d
```

## Introduction

I built Trackeep because I was tired of juggling a dozen different apps for my digital life. You know how it is – bookmarks in one place, tasks in another, random notes scattered everywhere, and that great article you meant to read somewhere in your browser history.

So I decided to build my own solution. Trackeep is basically the app I wish I had – one place to store, organize, and track everything that matters to me. It's open-source and self-hosted because I believe your data should belong to you, not some corporation.

It's like if Papra, Notion, Pocket and a todo app had a baby. Built by one person (with AI's help), for anyone who's tired of their digital life being a mess.

### My Design Inspiration

I've always been a huge fan of **Papra** – their clean, minimalistic approach just makes sense. Everything feels intentional and puts your content first.

So yeah, Trackeep borrows heavily from that design philosophy. But I wrote every line of code from scratch – this isn't some copy-paste job. I took that beautiful simplicity and tried to expand it into more of a productivity and knowledge management tool.

### The AI-Assisted Journey

This project was built with **Windsurf SWE 1.5**.

Look, I'll be honest – I'm not the best coder out there. But I really wanted to build something that solves real problems, and I think passion matters more than being perfect. Windsurf helped me figure out the hard stuff, learn new technologies, and actually build something I'm proud of.

As a solo dev, having an AI pair programmer made this whole thing possible. Go backend, SolidJS frontend, React Native app – stuff I probably couldn't have tackled alone. It's pretty cool what you can create when humans and AI work together, even when you're still learning.

With Trackeep, everything you save is centralized, searchable, and easy to manage, while remaining self-hosted so you maintain full privacy and ownership – just as it should be.

## Project Status

Trackeep is my labor of love – constantly evolving with core functionalities that I use every day. As a solo developer, I'm building this in the open, adding features based on real needs and feedback from fellow digital wanderers. The platform includes multiple services working together to create the productivity hub I've always wanted.

Every feature you see is something I personally needed and use. Your feedback, bug reports, and feature ideas aren't just welcome – they're what help shape this tool into something that can help others organize their digital lives too.

## Features

### Core Functionality
- **Bookmarks & Link Management**: Save and categorize links, articles, videos, and web resources
- **Learning & Progress Tracking**: Track courses, tutorials, and personal learning paths
- **Task & To-Do Lists**: Plan future tasks, create checklists, and mark completed items
- **Media & File Storage**: Upload, store, and manage documents, presentations, images,... (just like Papra)
- **Notes & Annotations**: Add personal notes to saved links, files, or tasks
- **Tagging & Organization**: Assign multiple tags or categories for efficient sorting

### Advanced Features
- **AI-Powered Recommendations**: Intelligent content suggestions and organization
- **Integrated Messaging (V1)**: Discord-style conversations (self chat, DMs, groups, team channels, global channels), realtime updates, smart suggestions, deep-link references, encrypted password vault sharing, voice notes, and browser-local optional transcription/call signaling
- **OAuth Integration**: Secure authentication with GitHub and other providers
- **Mobile App**: Native React Native application for iOS and Android
- **Email Ingestion**: Send/forward emails to automatically import content
- **Content Extraction**: Automatically extract text from images or scanned documents
- **Smart Tagging Rules**: Automatically tag content based on custom rules
- **Full-Text Search**: Quickly search across all your content with advanced filtering
- **Dark Mode**: Beautiful dark theme for low-light environments
- **Responsive Design**: Works seamlessly on desktop, tablet, and mobile devices

### Privacy & Self-Hosting
- **Fully Self-Hosted**: No third-party servers required – everything runs on your own infrastructure
- **Data Ownership**: Your data remains yours – encrypted, controlled, and never leaves your systems
- **Open Source**: Transparent codebase you can audit, modify, and trust
- **API Access**: Build custom applications on top of Trackeep
- **AI Control**: Full control over which AI services (if any) you want to use

### AI Services (Optional & Configurable)

Trackeep includes AI features, but you're in complete control:

**Currently Integrated:**
- **LongCat AI** – For content recommendations, smart tagging, and text extraction
- **DeepSeek** – Advanced reasoning and content analysis capabilities
- **Mistral AI** – European AI with strong privacy focus
- **Grok (xAI)** – Real-time knowledge and witty responses
- **Ollama** – Self-hosted local AI models (run completely offline)
- **OpenAI Compatible** – Can be configured with any OpenAI-compatible API endpoint

**Your Options:**
- ✅ **Use all AI features** – Full experience with intelligent automation
- ✅ **Use specific AI services** – Enable only the features you want
- ✅ **Use only local AI** – Run completely offline with Ollama
- ✅ **Disable all AI** – Run Trackeep completely without any AI integration
- ✅ **Replace with your own** – Configure custom AI endpoints or self-hosted models

**A Note on AI Services & Privacy:**

Look, I want to be completely transparent with you. **DeepSeek and LongCat AI are Chinese companies**, and I totally get if that raises some concerns for you. Data privacy is serious business.

But here's my honest take: with the pricing they offer (especially DeepSeek's incredibly cheap API), I personally feel more comfortable giving my data to them than to ChatGPT at their prices. Plus, you're in complete control – you can disable any service you don't want, or stick to European options like Mistral, or even run everything locally with Ollama.

The beauty of Trackeep is that **you decide**. No hidden data collection, no forced AI usage – just transparent options that you control.

**Privacy First:**
- All AI processing happens through your configured endpoints
- No data sent to third-party services without your explicit configuration
- AI features can be completely disabled for maximum privacy
- Full transparency about what data is sent to AI services
- Local AI option with Ollama for complete offline privacy

**Example Configurations:**
```bash
# Disable all AI
DISABLE_AI=true

# Use only European AI (Mistral)
MISTRAL_API_KEY=your-key
DISABLE_LONGCAT=true
DISABLE_DEEPSEEK=true
DISABLE_GROK=true

# Use only local AI (Ollama)
OLLAMA_BASE_URL=http://localhost:11434
